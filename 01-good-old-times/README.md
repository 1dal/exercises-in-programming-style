==============================

Constraints:

- Very small amount of primary memory, typically orders of magnitude
  smaller than the data that needs to be processed/generated. 
  (The example sets the limit to 1024 bytes)

- No symbols -- i.e. no variable names or labels. All we have is
  addressable memory.

Possible names:

- Good old times
- Early 50s style
