Style #23
==============================

Constraints:

- Every single procedure and function checks the sanity of its
  arguments and refuses to continue when the arguments are
  unreasonable, throwing an exception

- When calling out other functions, core program functions don't check for errors

- Exception handling occurs only at the top level of a function call chain

Possible names:

- Passive aggressive
