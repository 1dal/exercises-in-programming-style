Style #6
==============================

Constraints:

- Existence of an abstraction to which all others can be converted. This
  main abstraction provides an interface to chain abstractions
  independent of the types of values that are consumed and produced by
  those abstractions

- Larger problem is solved as a pipeline of functions bound together
  by the single interface that chains them

Possible names:

- The One
- Monadic
- The wrapper of all things
- Imperative functional style
