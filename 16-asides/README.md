Style #16
==============================

Constraints:

- The problem is decomposed using some form of abstraction (procedures, functions, objects, etc.)

- Aspects of the problem are added to the main program without any
  edits to the abstractions. These side functions latch on the main
  functions by naming "join points"


Possible names:

- Asides
- Aspect-oriented style
- Rewriting the story
