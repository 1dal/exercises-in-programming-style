Style #20
==============================

Constraints:

- Every single procedure and function checks the sanity of its
  arguments and either returns something sensible when the arguments
  are unreasonable or assigns them reasonable values

- All code blocks check for all possible errors and escape the block
  when things go wrong

Possible names:

- Defensive
- Pessimistic
- Never trust the caller nor the callee
