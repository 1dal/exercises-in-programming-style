Style #9
==============================

Constraints:

- Existence of an abstraction to which all functions can be converted. This
  main abstraction provides an interface to (1) wrap around values, so that they
  become the abstraction; and (2) bind wrapped values to functions, so
  to establish sequences of functions.

- Larger problem is solved as a pipeline of functions bound together
  by the single interface that chains them.

Possible names:

- The One
- Monadic Identity
- The wrapper of all things
- Imperative functional style
